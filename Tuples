Topic: Tuples

“Tuples group multiple values into a single compound value. The values within a tuple can be of any type and do not have to be of the same type as each other.”

Tuples are a concept unique to swift. Tuples are used to group multiple values into one compound value.
In Objective-C the values must be the same type in order to create a compound values. However, in Swift, the values can be of any type.
You can have a tuple of (Int, String) or (Int, String, Int) or (Int, String, Bool) or just a plain old (String, String, String).

let supBen = ("hi, ben", 47)

Here, the tuple is composed with (String, Int).
You can decompose a tuple from there, which helps receive separate parts of the tuple

let (sayingHiToBen, randomNumber) = supBen
print(sayingHiToBen)
hi, ben

You can also use the index numbers inside the tuple starting at 0.
print(supBen.0)
hi, ben
print(supBen.1)
47
